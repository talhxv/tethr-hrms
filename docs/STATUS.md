# Foundation Status

> As of 2026-09-04 (`feat/attendance-module-and-ux-revamp`). Phases 0–2 plus the V1 portal foundation are complete; Finance F1 (payroll core) and F2 (billing core) are built and smoke-verified — see [finance-plan.md](finance-plan.md). **Attendance is now exposed and guarded**, and the employee/onboarding surfaces have been reworked. Sections below run newest-first.

## Attendance exposure + authorization fix (2026-09-04)

**Security.** `modules/attendance` was fully built but had never been wired to authorization: `attendance.resolver.ts` was the only module resolver carrying no `@UseGuards`/`@RequirePermissions`, there is no `APP_GUARD`, and `PERMISSIONS` had no attendance entries at all. Because `PermissionsGuard` returns `true` when a handler has no metadata, every clock and timesheet operation was reachable by any caller, for any `employeeId`.

- Added `attendance:own:read` / `own:write` / `team:read` / `approve`, split the way leave is, and granted them across the six system roles (employees get the `own:*` pair; Tethr HR and client admins get `team:read` + `approve`; Tethr Finance gets `team:read` since payroll needs hours).
- Guarded every attendance operation.
- Added `clockInMe` / `clockOutMe` / `myTimeEntries`, which resolve the employee from the session the way `submitMyLeaveRequest` does — holding `attendance:own:write` can no longer clock a colleague in. The admin `clockIn(employeeId)` now sits behind `attendance:approve`, since clocking someone else in is a correction, not self-service.
- Dropped the `submittedByUserId` / `approvedByUserId` **arguments** from `submitTimesheet` / `approveTimesheet` and took the actor from the session — they were free text, so the audit trail could be attributed to anyone.
- **Regression test:** `core/authz/resolver-guards.spec.ts` walks every `*.resolver.ts` and fails on any operation lacking `@RequirePermissions` outside an explicit public allowlist. Writing it surfaced **seven pre-existing gaps**, listed in `KNOWN_UNGUARDED` so they stay visible: `clients`, and the six `createEmployeeEducation` / `updateEmployeeEducation` / `deleteEmployeeEducation` / `create|update|deleteEmployeeWorkHistory` mutations — same bug class, any authenticated caller can write education and work history for any employee id. A third test makes that list shrink-only. **Still open; close before real users.**
- **Role permission drift** (the F2 follow-up noted below) now has a tool rather than a re-seed: `npm run sync:role-permissions -w @hrms/api` backfills additively — it only adds permissions a definition lists and a row lacks, never removes, so admin customisations survive. The persisted rows happened to be current when checked (57/57 rows matched), but `ensureSystemRole` still returns existing rows untouched, so the underlying drift remains by design.

**Time & attendance UI** (People sub-nav, Tethr + client portals, `/attendance`): employee picker plus date range; **Time entries** tab with a manual "record hours" form for corrections; **Timesheets** tab exposing the open → submit → approve → lock lifecycle, each row offering only the action its status allows. Write actions render only for `tethrAdmin` / `tethrHr` / `clientAdmin`. Clock in/out deliberately lives in the *employee* portal instead — `clockInMe` needs a session linked to an employee, and Tethr staff are not employees.

**Verified live**, not just compiled: logged in as `employee@demo.test` and exercised `clockInMe` → clock event, `clockOutMe` → time entry, `myTimeEntries` → reads back. Unauthenticated calls now return `UNAUTHENTICATED` (401) rather than the old validation failure.

**Constraint worth knowing:** there is no workspace-wide attendance query — `timeEntries` and `timesheets` are both per-employee, which is why the page is scoped by a picker rather than showing a roster grid. A roster view needs a new resolver.

## UX rework (2026-09-04)

Driven by Deel as the reference; the recurring fault was full records crammed into a 500px rail or a single wide auto-fit grid.

- **Onboarding intakes** (employee and workspace) are now full-page stepped flows: titled cards, a vertical step rail with per-step hints, a sticky footer, and a review step with per-section Edit. Shared chrome lives in `web/src/components/onboarding/` so `modules/clients` and `modules/employees` don't import each other.
- **Employee record** moved from thirteen accordions in the preview rail to `/employees/:employeeId` — a sticky identity column plus five tabs (Profile, Job & pay, Documents, Onboarding, Access & exit). `DetailSection` now defaults to open, since the tabs do the narrowing. The rail is a preview: headline facts and an "Open record" button, costing no extra query. `EmployeesListPage` went 3,027 → 443 lines; shared types/formatters extracted to `modules/employees/employee.shared.ts`.
- **Org chart** is its own sub-nav tab (`/employees/org-chart`), sharing the page component so selection and the rail are common.
- **Directory** gained search, multi-select status/worker-type filter chips with count badges, a live row count, and three real empty states. "Onboard employee" became a grouped `ActionMenu` whose shortcuts prefill worker type.
- **Employee self-service**: profile promoted to `/me/profile` with the same identity-column layout. This surfaced **eleven fields that were being sent to `updateMyEmployeeProfile` but had no inputs** — permanent address, both accommodation types, contact channel, and emergency contact. No data was being lost (`profileFrom` hydrated them), but employees could not set them. The `/me` rail is now a pinned clock card plus Request leave / Feedback tabs.
- **Client portfolio** side panel replaced a static role glossary with a live rollup plus a "needs attention" list for clients that have no workspace, each linking into a pre-scoped onboarding flow.
- Added `finalConfirmationDate` to employee onboarding — it was already sent to `createEmployee` but nothing ever set it.

**Gates:** typecheck clean across all packages, **132 tests passing** (api 107 incl. 3 new guard specs, shared 20, ui 5), 0 lint errors, production build clean.

> The sections below are the pre-Finance status record (as of 2026-08-24, `finance` branch).

## Finance F2 — billing core (this branch)

- **New `modules/billing`:** `client_billing_configs` (PEPM fee, Net-7 terms, anchor day 20, receiver/sender/bank facts), `billing_groups` with per-group SP/EP-style prefixes, `billing_group_members` (current group + agreed fixed USD rate per employee), and the invoice pipeline: `invoices` + `invoice_lines` with draft → issued → paid lifecycle. Services invoices auto-draft from a finalized payroll run via the idempotent `payroll.finalized` consumer; expenses invoices open manually for pass-through lines.
- **Drafting engine:** advance billing (on/after the anchor day the document covers the following month); catch-up lines for past months never invoiced, pro-rated by working days actually worked (`proratedAmount` — money rounds once); one PEPM fee line per billed person; receiver snapshot frozen at creation; uniqueness by group+type+service month makes re-runs no-ops.
- **Issue & settle:** human numbers `{prefix}{sequence}` assigned only at issue counting issued/paid only (drafts never burn numbers); issuing freezes the document (edits rejected) and emits `invoice.issued` transactionally; mark-paid records date + reference. Client read path (`billing:own:read`) exposes issued/paid only.
- **RBAC:** `billing:read/write` on Tethr Finance, `billing:own:read` on client roles.
- **Web:** `/billing` (terms editor, groups, rates, invoices list, manual expenses-invoice opener) and `/billing/:invoiceId` (line drill-down, add/remove pass-through lines while draft, approve & issue, mark paid).
- **Verified:** typecheck/lint/build green; API tests 96 passing incl. 12 new billing specs; 19-check HTTP smoke passed live (catch-up math 900×8/21=342.86 for the Aug-20 joiner, advance window Aug 20→Sep 20, issue → `SP0001`, immutability rejection, client visibility, settlement, idempotent re-draft).
- **Known follow-ups for F3+:** PDF generation & download, credit notes if ever needed (draft-edit-only per scope), payslip/invoice emailing once SMTP exists, effective-dated group memberships if mid-month team moves become real, and the system-role permission drift issue (persisted tenant role rows don't track shipped definition updates — dev workaround: re-seed; product fix candidate: sync-on-ensure in `ensureSystemRole`).

## Finance F1 — payroll core (this branch)

- **New `modules/payroll`:** monthly runs (`draft → finalized`, one per period), draft lines with working-day pro-rata (mid-month joiners) minus approved unpaid leave via the leave published interface, structure-driven component breakdown snapshots, PK progressive withholding engine from tenant-configured slabs with per-line override, finalization into immutable `payslips`/`payslip_lines` snapshots, per-tenant sequential payslip numbers (`PS-YYYYMM-0001`), bank advice CSV (account facts via the employee-records published interface), and the transactional `payroll.finalized` outbox event carrying the true total.
- **Compensation extension:** `salary_structure_components` (percentOfGross / fixedMonthly) with replace-all validation (percents ≤ 100); breakdown resolved through `getStructureComponentBreakdown`; GraphQL query/mutation for composition.
- **RBAC:** new permissions (`payroll:read/write/finalize`, `payslip:read`, `payslip:own:read`); new `tethrFinance` system role (Tethr portal); employees gain self-service payslip reads.
- **Web:** `/payroll` runs list + draft creation + tax-slab group management; `/payroll/:runId` line grid with component drill-down, tax override editing, regenerate/remove while draft, finalize & lock, bank advice download, issued-payslips table. Nav item gated to Tethr Admin/Finance.
- **Verified:** typecheck/lint/build green across packages; API tests 83 passing incl. calculator + lifecycle specs; 24-check HTTP smoke against Docker Postgres passed (pro-rata = 8 days for an Aug-20 joiner, engine tax = 500 on 60k taxable at the 720k annual band, override round-trip, immutable payslip, bank advice CSV, `payroll.finalized` in outbox).
- **Known follow-ups for F2+:** billing module consuming `payroll.finalized`; payslip emails once SMTP exists; catch-up/arrears suggestion pass; bootstrap gap — `signUp` yields only clientAdmin and `onboardClient` requires an existing tethrAdmin, so brand-new installs have no seed path to Tethr-side roles (dev DB was promoted manually for testing).

## V1 Portal Foundation

- Tenant-scoped role assignments resolve effective permissions, expose backend-sourced assignable workspace roles, and select one of the `tethr`, `client`, or `employee` portals. Signup seeds the first user as a persisted `clientAdmin`; role checks now protect employee, leave, and compensation boundaries.
- Client users have a people overview with live-data-driven onboarding progress, read-only employee directory, hiring-request workflow with persisted update history, compensation workspace, shared leave-request monitoring, and role-aware workspace-user screen. Client admins can add teammates and update API-provided assignable access roles. The selected-employee panel now surfaces client-facing details: headshot/profile, DOB, joining/probation facts, role, current salary, inline effective-dated salary adjustments, assessment history/new assessment action, client-visible document versions/signature status, and bonus history/award action for permitted roles.
- Employees have a dedicated self-service workspace with explicit employment facts for joining date, days since joining, probation end/days left, annual/monthly salary, leave balances/requests with submitted/decision timestamps and Tethr decision notes, a compact month-grouped upcoming-holidays calendar, contact/address/profile-photo updates, news bulletin, and feedback submission. Own-record GraphQL operations derive the employee identity from the authenticated user rather than accepting it from the browser.
- Tethr HR/Admin role definitions and navigation are available. Tethr Admin can list/onboard client workspaces, seed the first client administrator, update workspace-user access levels from the backend policy matrix, and link existing users to employee records when assigning employee access. Tethr users can onboard employee records through a dedicated intake, manage hiring request statuses with client-visible update notes/history, publish announcements, triage employee feedback, triage/approve/reject leave requests with employee/client/Tethr request trail metadata, record assessments, revise effective-dated salary, prepare employee document upload/download access, attach employee documents, add document versions/signature metadata, request manual e-signature envelopes, manage employee onboarding checklists, award bonuses, and maintain Tethr-only private HR records through live GraphQL-backed slices.
- New V1 backend modules/surfaces: account-level client workspace onboarding, `modules/recruitment` for client hiring requests, `modules/engagement` for announcements and employee feedback, `modules/employee-records` for assessment/document links, Tethr-only HR records, and onboarding checklists, document version/signature metadata inside `core/documents`, and compensation bonus awards inside `modules/compensation`.
- Still incomplete for full V1: real object-storage binary transfer and provider-backed e-signature execution behind the document access descriptors, custom roles/data scopes beyond the system-role access levels, and payroll.

## Current Verification Note

- `npm run build:contracts`, `npm run typecheck -w @hrms/api`, `npm run typecheck -w @hrms/web`, API tests (18 suites / 63 tests), and `npm run build` pass after the V1 portal, live client onboarding progress, engagement, records, hiring update-history, backend-sourced access-role assignment, bonus, salary-adjustment, leave-handshake, employee self-service employment facts/holiday calendar, Tethr HR private-record, employee-linked access-level editing, document access/version/signature requests, and HR onboarding checklist slices. The web build currently emits Vite's large-chunk warning at ~554.29 kB minified JS.
- `npm install --include=optional` restored the missing WSL/Linux optional packages for Rollup and ESLint's resolver. `npm run lint` exits successfully with 30 pre-existing import-order warnings; there are no lint errors.

### Verified running locally (Docker) — 2026-06-20

`docker compose up -d` (Postgres + Redis) → `npm run start -w @hrms/api`. The app
boots, TypeORM `synchronize` creates all **28 tables**, and GraphQL serves at
http://localhost:3000/graphql. Exercised end to end:

- **Core HR:** `createEmployee` then `employees` (tenant-scoped) round-trip.
- **Leave:** create leave type → submit request (costed at 5 working days, Mon–Fri)
  → approve (balance reserved, then spent).
- **Attendance:** clock in/out → time entry → timesheet open → submit → approve → lock.
- Tenant guard fires on Phase 2 queries too: no `x-organization-id` header →
  `TENANT_CONTEXT_MISSING`.
- Every state change wrote its event to the transactional **outbox** in the same
  transaction (`employee.created`, `leave.requested`, `leave.approved`,
  `timesheet.submitted`, `timesheet.locked` — the last two feed Payroll), confirmed
  in Postgres.

The web app at http://localhost:5173 was driven end to end in the browser: **sign
up → dashboard** (live metrics) → **Employees** (live; created an employee through
the form and it appeared) → **sign out** redirects to /login, and hitting a
protected route while signed out redirects to /login. The tenant comes from the
JWT (no dev header). See README "Quick start".

## Implemented (working, tested)

- **`@hrms/shared`** — branded IDs, domain unions, the typed domain-event contract
  (discriminated on `name`), half-open effective-dating math, pure utils.
- **`@hrms/ui`** — design tokens (light + dark) with compile-time parity, exposed
  as the full CSS-variable contract (color, spacing scale, layout, motion, type),
  from design.md. A test locks the contract so the generator can't drop a token
  the component CSS relies on.
- **`@hrms/api` — `core/` platform:** fail-fast config (zod), database + base
  entities (`BaseEntity` / `TenantScopedEntity` / `TemporalEntity`), tenancy
  (AsyncLocalStorage context + auto-scoping repository + provider factory +
  middleware), events (transactional **outbox** + in-process bus + **idempotent
  consumer** + relay), append-only **audit**, auth (User≠Employee, scrypt password
  hashing, `employee.terminated` consumer), authz (permissions + Role + guard),
  and light workflow/notifications/documents service interfaces. The entrypoint
  loads `.env` (dotenv) and enables dev CORS so the SPA can call the API.
- **`@hrms/api` — `modules/` domain spine:** organization (Organization tenant
  root + legal entity/location/department/cost-center), position (job/grade/pay
  band/job-family/position), employee (full GraphQL vertical: entity, published
  `EmployeeDirectory`, service emitting events in-transaction + audit, resolver),
  assignment (effective-dated, non-overlap guard).
- **`@hrms/api` — Phase 2 modules (`modules/`):** **leave** (config-as-data leave
  types, per-period balances with reserve→spend, holiday calendars, working-day
  costing via shared helpers, requests routed through the workflow engine, GraphQL
  vertical; emits `leave.requested`/`approved`/`rejected`/`cancelled`);
  **attendance** (clock-in/out → time entries, timesheet lifecycle
  open→submit→approve→lock, GraphQL vertical; emits `timesheet.submitted`/`locked`).
  `leave.approved` and `timesheet.locked` are the inputs Payroll will consume.
- **`@hrms/api` — auth (core/auth + modules/account):** `@nestjs/jwt` login + `me`
  (core), tenant signup that creates org + admin user (modules/account, composing
  Organization + Auth published interfaces). The TenantContextMiddleware verifies
  the bearer token and sets tenant + principal from it (x-organization-id stays as
  a dev fallback). Stateless JWT — no per-request auth DB hit. Workspace-user
  provisioning and role updates reuse persisted system roles and enforce which
  roles the current admin may assign.
- **`@hrms/api` — Phase 3 compensation started (`modules/compensation`):** pay
  component config, salary structures, effective-dated salary revisions, and
  one-off bonus awards.
  Salary revisions validate employees through the published `EmployeeDirectory`
  interface, close the prior open-ended revision, emit `compensation.revised`,
  and avoid cross-module database foreign keys. This slice has focused service
  tests and schema coverage; type-check, tests, lint, and build now pass.
- **`@hrms/api` — `core/documents`:** document metadata now carries an initial
  `document_versions` history. New versions update the latest storage pointer
  while preserving prior storage keys, size/content facts, signature status,
  signed date, provider, and envelope ID. The document boundary now returns
  provider-shaped upload/download access descriptors and can open a manual
  e-signature request against the latest version; real object-storage byte
  transfer and provider-backed e-signature execution remain follow-up
  infrastructure.
- **`@hrms/api` — V1 portal extensions (`modules/recruitment`,
  `modules/engagement`, `modules/employee-records`):** client hiring requests
  with persisted client-visible update history and Tethr status updates; announcements/news bulletin; employee feedback
  submission and Tethr triage; team leave inbox/approve/reject handoff with
  submitted/decided timestamps and decision notes shared across employee,
  client, and Tethr views;
  assessment history; employee document links with portal visibility plus
  upload/download access descriptors, version/signature metadata reads,
  version-add actions, and manual e-signature requests; Tethr-only HR
  records for role, salary breakdown, bank credentials, hardware information,
  and employee record form data; and Tethr-only onboarding checklists for
  profile, contract, NDA, resume, bank details, hardware, and employee record
  form capture. Each module is
  tenant-scoped, references employees/documents by ID, emits typed domain events,
  and has focused service tests plus schema coverage.
- **`@hrms/api` — Account/client onboarding (`modules/account` +
  `modules/organization`):** Tethr Admin can list client workspaces and onboard a
  new client tenant with its first `clientAdmin` user. Client user creation runs
  inside the newly created tenant context and assigns persisted RBAC data.
- **`@hrms/web`** — React + Vite + Jotai app with **authentication**: login &
  signup pages, token persisted to localStorage (read on init), Apollo auth link
  (bearer), protected routes, sign-out. A live **dashboard** (real metrics), a live
  **Employees** directory (table + master-detail + working create/onboarding form,
  role/salary/profile/probation/inline salary adjustments/document upload and
  download access, document versions/signature status/e-sign
  requests/assessments/bonus detail surface plus Tethr-only private HR record
  and onboarding checklist editors),
  a live-data-driven client onboarding walkthrough, a workspace-user access editor with employee
  record linking for employee access, a live
  **Compensation** workspace (pay components, salary structures, salary
  revision history, and create/revise forms), **Client portfolio**, **Hiring
  requests** with client-visible update history, employee self-service holiday calendar, **Leave triage** with
  shared request-trail metadata, **Announcements**, **Employee feedback**, and
  role-aware portal home screens wired to the GraphQL API, a shell
  showing the signed-in user, theme provider (light/dark) — all on design tokens.
- **`@hrms/worker`** — queue abstraction (BullMQ) + example processor + runner.

## Scaffolded (shape in place, to be fleshed out)

- Auth: refresh tokens, MFA, password policy, signup email verification, and
  populating the JWT with the user's permissions (login/signup/me + the JWT
  middleware guard are done).
- Authz: populating the request principal and registering `PermissionsGuard`
  (globally or per-resolver); data-scope enforcement in services.
- Workflow: approval chains/steps/escalation behind `WorkflowService`.
- Notifications: real per-channel delivery + templating behind `NotificationService`.
- Documents: real object-storage byte transfer and provider-backed e-signature execution behind `DocumentService`.
- Web: pages for the other live modules (Time off, Attendance, Organization,
  Positions) — currently disabled nav placeholders; and GraphQL codegen → typed
  hooks (queries are hand-written `gql` for now). The Employees detail panel will
  show department/manager/location once those fields are exposed over GraphQL.
- DB: generate the initial migration (see `packages/api/src/core/database/migrations/README.md`).

## Not yet started / next (roadmap)

Phase 3 Payroll remains next after the Compensation slice is hardened in browser
smoke testing. Payroll will consume `leave.approved`, `timesheet.locked`, and
`compensation.revised`, then lifecycle/talent and services/insight follow
(plan.md §4, §8). The spine, platform, and time-off/attendance inputs are in
place for them.

## Key decisions & deviations

- **npm workspaces over Nx** (architecture.md §15 deviation) — zero-install,
  fully verifiable. TS project-reference-free; packages build in explicit order.
- **Within-package imports are relative; `@/`,`~/` aliases** are wired via
  tsc-alias (build) + jest mapper. Cross-package uses real package names.
- **`@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports` is OFF** — it conflicts with
  NestJS constructor injection (its autofix turns DI class imports into
  `import type`, erasing the `emitDecoratorMetadata` reference and breaking DI).
- **Half-open date ranges** `[validFrom, validTo)` so adjacent records neither
  overlap nor gap.
- **GraphQL schema generated in memory** at boot (no filesystem dependency).
- **Vite consumes internal packages from source** (avoids CJS named-export interop).

## Known follow-ups / risks

- ⚠️ **Apollo Server v4 reached end-of-life 2026-01-26.** It works, but plan an
  upgrade to Apollo Server v5 + `@nestjs/apollo`/`@nestjs/graphql` v13 + NestJS v11.
- Generate the initial DB migration before any non-dev deploy.
- Wire the authenticated principal into `TenantContext` (the middleware currently
  reads an `x-organization-id` header as a dev shim).
